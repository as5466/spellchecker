# spellchecker
#### This program checks for possible misspellings of the word that the user has entered. It checks if there are extra letters at the beggining or the end, if there are missing letters at the beginning or the end, or if adjacent letters are swapped. Based on these tests, the program outputs a list of alternative spellings from the knowledge base of words. It also allows the user to add a word to the dictionary so the same word is not flagged again.
